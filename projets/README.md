# Modelling project

During this training, some time is devoted to the realization of an architectural and functional model (called FSPM) of a fruiting tree. Some hypothesis on the model should be set and address using a sensitivity analysis on the model. A presentation of the model, its hypothesis, the related bibliography, the analysis of the model and the biological conclusion should be prepared for the examination day.
The list of proposed fruiting trees to model with related information are given bellow:
